# Electric-Reactive-To-Do üìù

## Overview üìñ
This is my very first take on Electron. Since I'm usually using React, I've combined them. YES, of course, it's a To-Do app. But it has some nice features and it's still in development, but fully functional. It's also important to note that it saves your data. I did it for fun, to get to know Electron and to refresh my TypeScript skills.

## Installation üíæ
To install and run this app, you will need Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, while npm is the package manager for Node.js.

Installation:
```
npm i
```
This will install all of the necessary dependencies.

Usage:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start all the needed scripts for you to explore it further.
